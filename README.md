# cat-ownership-simulator-2022
Simulates the ownership of cats in the year of our lord 2022.

HOW TO PLAY

You are a cat addict. If you don't have enough cats for 4 days straight, YOU WILL DIE. Every 50 days you will need more cats. 

Cats need to be fed and treated. The quality of your home affects how often your cats will get sick, the more expensive it is, the safer your cats will be.

You can take ONE action per day, don't waste it!

You have goals visible in the lower right corner. Achieve these 2 goals and you will be free from your cat addiction! (You can hover over the goal image to see your progress)

You can have a job, but watch out! If you skip too many days you will be fired (or worse). At the start your job experience will be limited, but as you work more and more,
you will be able to get better and better jobs. Your work experience is divided into categories (Odd job exp, Street crime exp, etc) which you need to progress down the
job listings. This experience is represented by a red bar that slowly fills up as you work.

Good luck!
